            <p>Every once In a while, I think I can make an AI that is "truly" creative or "superintelligent" using gpus from Kaggle</p>
            <p>Like a retard</p>
            <p>I know I'm going to try this again...</p>
            <p>I have different AI versions for when I get a working result each time ("working" means they output text)</p>
            <p>I've done this since BEFORE CHATGPT LAUNCHED. This is how I learned Chatgpt launched, actually!</p>
            <p>And I don't remember my life from when ChatGPT launched, meaning I've probobly done this for even longer</p>
            <p>Anyway, I have freddy0.1, freddy0.2, freddy0.3, freddy0.3-creative, and freddy0.4, plus a bunch of versions not on the naming system that work!</p>
            <p>One of the times I combined Gemma 27b from google with a random next-word generator, taking a big dataset and combining next words, creating sorta-working sentances but nothing coherent</p>
            <p>Gemma 27b was supposed to find "creative" ideas in this mess, and only thought of the same bullshit it always thinks of!</p>
