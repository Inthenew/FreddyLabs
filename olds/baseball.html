            <p>So in April 2025 I quit FreddyBOT for a month, and for like ~a week in the middle of this quitting periods, i decided to lock in and try to restart the project!</p>
            <p>I convinced someone to give me their container of VERY old baseball cards, and that I would make my robot sort through it!</p>
            <p>After that week I quit because It was harder than I thought, PLUS it had little incentive money wise!</p>
