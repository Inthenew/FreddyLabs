            <p>I LOVE THIS ONE</p>
            <p>So someone in mid 2022 (when I was 13) told me to make an app to get people to act towards their goals,</p>
            <p>and people could join into these goals and stuff, i don't actually understand/remember the idea completely.</p>
            <p>I never really did, but I know it was not actually a bad idea!</p>
            <p>My life would've been completely different right now if my computer didn't break MID PROJECT</p>
            <p>That was so annoying, cause I lost so many old projects I don't remember through this</p>
            <p>So in June of 2025, I managed to write a script to run on this old computer in recovery mode to search through the hard drive unindexed, sorting through raw data</p>
            <p>I organized everything into hundreds of folders with 500 files in each into a USB drive, and got a whole lot of files (I only searched 20% of the computer)</p>
            <p>I got the whole project out of this!</p>
            <p>I managed to run it one last time, and I can't now cause glitch.com is shut down (ugh, I could still run it again if I tried)</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Anyway here is an image I had when working on it:</p>
