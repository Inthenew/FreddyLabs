            <p>I spent 1.5 years making this game for someone right after I turned 15. I made $100 a month at first (with a lot of work), and eventually I got it to $300 with 1 hour of work a day, 5 days a week.</p>
            <p>I quit 4 times in total I think. The game is doing well with (as last checked) ~40k likes!!</p>
            <p>The name sucks I did NOT name it!!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>If you want to try the laggy, shitty game, here it is (won't work at screwl, proxy doesn't even work :/):</p>
