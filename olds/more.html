            <p>I have started wayyyyyyyyyyyyy more projects then in this list</p>
            <p>Some so stupid I'm too scared to say!</p>
            <p>Most I just forgot they even exist</p>
            <p>Another big chunk of them had no name and I forgot to run the project so I have the code but don't know what the fuck it is!</p>
            <p>Sooooo yeah</p>
            <p>My latest quit project is not on this list, for that reason, actually!</p>
            <p>It was some VLA (vision language action model) model that was supposed to "few-shot learn" anything, just "like a human", using "large, sparse datasets"</p>
            <p>Let's say I worked on that for 3 days and then dropped it!!</p>
