            <p>Mid 2023 I was obsessed with IP camera apps, and tied my shitty $25 phone to remote control cars to control them from afar!</p>
            <p>I didn't like that these apps didn't have many features, not even sound...</p>
            <p>So I tried to make one that does that! And I wanted to put it on the app store and get money some how!!</p>
            <p>Guess who quit once again!!</p>
