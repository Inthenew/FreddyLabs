            <p>I forked a Three.js (some graphics library) game from some random person on Github and added stuff to it after I quit. </p>
            <p>I loved their game for years before and was mad that they weren't making updates...</p>
            <p>It took me multiple years to actually figure out how to run their game in development!</p>
            <p>I eventually did and made a bunch of updates at random times!</p>
            <p>It got me a job later, (the Street Slickers game)!</p>
            <p>The game link in the project doesn't work anymore right now cause glitch.com shut down</p>
            <p>I'm gonna have to update it (I'm not editing this text here so I might have done this already)</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Here's the link to the project:</p>
